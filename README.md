# CS300 Linked Lists

Southern New Hampshire University CS300, week 3 project. This repo contains
the original starter code for the project, and is intended for grading
student submissions. File LinkedList.cpp is the only file to be altered
by students. This file can be replaced by the student submission for
grading, and can be reverted so as to grade the next submission.
